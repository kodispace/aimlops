        "Substances in traditional fire-extinguishing techniques may leave chemical waste, harm human health and cause social and economic damages. Therefore research on fire-extinguishing using renewable energy sources is important. The impact of sound waves on flame and combustion behavior of fuel is a common.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fire is a chemical reaction that breaks out with the combination of heat, fuel, and oxygen components. The heat, gas, and smoke resulting from this oxidation reaction may significantly harm to human and the environment. Early intervention to the fire facilitates to extinguish. However, **depending on the scale of the fire and the fuel type, fire-extinguishing agents may vary**. These substances in traditional fire-extinguishing techniques may leave chemical waste and harm human health. Additionally, it can also cause social and economic damages. In order to eliminate these impacts, researches on fire-extinguishing with renewable energy sources have been carried out. Currently, **the impact of sound waves on flame and combustion behavior of fuel is a common research topic**. The pressure changes in the air as a result of the sound waves lead to the occurrence of airflow. This airflow changes the behavior of the flame, fuel, and oxygen in the environment. The airflow created by the sound waves enables the fuel to spread over a wider surface. At this phase, the flame shows the tendency of spreading over a wide area together with the fuel. Fuel consumption also increases by the fuel particle oscillation due to the spread of flame and sound waves. While these stages are taking place, the air in the fire environment mixes and the amount of oxygen decreases as a result of the compression and expansion movements in the air. Through the combination of these three events, the flame can be extinguished. Necessary frequency ranges are available for the flame to be extinguished with the sound waves. Besides the frequency characteristic of sound waves, sound intensity level and the distance are also the factors having an impact on the ability to extinguish the flame.\n",
        "\n",
        "Utilizing the fire characteristics, studies have been carried out to estimate the parameters necessary for the detection and extinguishing of the fire. The **data have been obtained by examining the characteristics of the flames extinguished using sound waves**. Statistical analysis and classification algorithms using these data provide information on the behaviour of the flame.\n",

        "The **Acoustic Extinguisher Fire Dataset** was obtained as a result of the extinguishing tests of four different fuel flames with a sound wave extinguishing system. The sound wave fire-extinguishing system consists of 4 subwoofers with a total power of 4,000 Watt placed in the collimator cabinet. There are two amplifiers that enable the sound come to these subwoofers as boosted. Power supply that powers the system and filter circuit ensuring that the sound frequencies are properly transmitted to the system is located within the control unit. While computer is used as frequency source, anemometer was used to measure the airflow resulted from sound waves during the extinguishing phase of the flame, and a decibel meter to measure the sound intensity. An infrared thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the flame and the fuel can, and a camera is installed to detect the extinction time of the flame. A total of 17,442 tests were conducted with this experimental setup.\n",

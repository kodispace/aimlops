### Project Overview: Structured Data Classification for Heart Disease Prediction

#### Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease using a structured data classification approach. The project leverages neural networks built using Keras and TensorFlow.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease dataset.
2. Pre-process this dataset using Keras layers: `IntegerLookup`, `StringLookup`, and `Normalization`.
3. Understand and use Keras concatenate layer.
4. Build a neural network architecture and model using Keras functional API.
5. Predict on unseen data.

#### Introduction to Structured Data Classification
Structured data classification involves predicting a target variable (in this case, the presence of heart disease) using structured input data, which includes both numerical and categorical features. The project uses Keras preprocessing layers to handle these features and builds a neural network to perform the classification.

#### Dataset
The dataset is provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease and contains 303 rows. Each row represents a patient, and each column describes an attribute of the patient. The features include both numerical and categorical data, and the target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

**Feature Description**:
- **Age**: Age in years (Numerical)
- **Sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) (Categorical)
- **CP**: Chest pain type (0-4) (Categorical)
- **Trestbpd**: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission (Numerical)
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numerical)
- **FBS**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) (Categorical)
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2) (Categorical)
- **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numerical)
- **Exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) (Categorical)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (Numerical)
- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2) (Categorical)
- **Ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy (Numerical)
- **Thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect) (Categorical)
- **Target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no) (Binary target)

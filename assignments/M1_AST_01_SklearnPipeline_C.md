#### Introduction to ML Pipelines
A machine learning pipeline is a sequence of steps involved in training a machine learning model. It automates the ML workflow and typically includes stages such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and post-processing. Pipelines help streamline the process, making it easier to manage and reproduce.

#### Problem Statement
Traditional fire-extinguishing methods can leave chemical waste, harm human health, and cause economic damages. Research is being conducted on using renewable energy sources for fire-extinguishing, particularly the impact of sound waves on flame and combustion behavior. This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of using sound waves for fire-extinguishing.
